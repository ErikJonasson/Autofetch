# Autofetch
Migration of a legacy hibernate tool that automates prefetching

## Installation
Originally, you needed to add the the two JAR:s generated by the ant-script to your buildpath. This should be changed to be Maven based.

## Goals
To migrate the tool to the newest version of Hibernate. It would be convenient to have at least one version for Hibernate 4.x aswell. 

## Requirements
Use the Java version used by the Hibernate ORM version you are using (Hibernate 3.2.5 as for now). 
As for now, the tool only uses a subset of the Hibernate 3.2.5 JAR:s.

## Documentation
The original documentation is included in the repo.
